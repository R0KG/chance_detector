# Your tasks:
# 1. Study the Tweepy documentation to understand how to:
#    - Authenticate with Twitter API
#    - Fetch tweets from specific users
#    - Handle pagination and rate limits

# 2. Implement keyword filtering:
#    - How would you efficiently check if a tweet contains any keywords?
#    - How can you make the search case-insensitive?
#    - How would you handle hashtags and mentions?

# 3. Think about error handling:
#    - What happens if Twitter is down?
#    - What if an account is private or suspended?
#    - How to handle API rate limits?
